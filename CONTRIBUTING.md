## General Guidelines

For general documentation about contributing to Jupyter projects, see the [Project Jupyter Contributor Documentation](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/content-contributor.html).

## Setting up a development environment

<!-- First, you need to fork the project. Then setup your environment:

```bash
# create a new conda environment
conda create -n xeus-sqlite -c conda-forge -c defaults xtl nlohmann_json cppzmq xeus
conda activate xeus-sqlite

# download xeus-sqlite from your GitHub fork
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/xeus-sqlite.git
```

You may also want to install a C++ compiler, and cmake from conda if they are not available on your system.
